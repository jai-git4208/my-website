                <h3 id="about">Ivelosi Pay: The Future of Payments Without Internet</h3>
                <p>For years, digital payments have been entirely dependent on traditional banking infrastructure and internet connectivity. But what happens when you're in an area with no signal, no WiFi, and no mobile data? Traditional payment systems fail. Ivelosi Pay is here to change that.</p>

                <h3 id="about">The Problem: Payments Shouldn't Depend on Internet</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Connectivity = No Transactions:</strong> In remote areas, during network outages, or even in crowded cities, payments fail due to weak or no internet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Banks & Payment Providers Control Everything:</strong> Every transaction passes through centralized servers, increasing fees and risks of censorship.</li>
                    <li><strong>Slow & Unreliable Systems:</strong> Traditional UPI transactions require constant banking server access, leading to failures and delays.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="about">The Solution: How Ivelosi Pay Works</h3>
                <p>Ivelosi Pay is a hybrid online & offline payment system that allows users to send and receive money even without an internet connection. Using a mix of Bluetooth, WiFi Direct, and peer-to-peer (P2P) technology, transactions are securely processed and synced later when connectivity is available.</p>
